User-Defined Functions for HDF5 - Python bindings
=================================================

HDF5 is a scientific file format that enables the storage and retrieval of
static datasets. HDF5-UDF enables the attachment of user-defined routines to
HDF5 files so that datasets can be produced on-the-fly by executing such
routines when the application reads the data. HDF5-UDF provides bindings for
the HDF5-UDF C/C++ library.

Please visit the `HDF5-UDF <https://hdf5-udf.readthedocs.io>`_
page for instructions on how to use this library and its page on
`GitHub <https://github.com/lucasvr/hdf5-udf>`_ for more details on the
infrastructure behind it.
